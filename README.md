## Organization of the repository
This repository is organized as follows.

 - "CAR_module" folder contains the original data and the codes used to obtain the results concerning the CAR T cell module of the model and described in Section 3.1 and S1.1.
 
 - "OV_module" folder contains the original data and the codes used to obtain the results concerning the OV module of the model and described in Section 3.2, S1.2, and S3.

 - "CAROV_module" folder contains the original data and the codes used to obtain the results concerning the complete CAR+OV model and described in Section 3.3 and S4.
